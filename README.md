This section of the repository includes four different applications: Snake game, Tic-Tac-Toe game, Text-editor, and Calculator. Each project is designed to showcase different aspects of Python programming and GUI development using Tkinter.


# Snake Game
The Snake game is a classic arcade game implemented using Python and Tkinter. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and its own body.

## Features
- Control the snake using the arrow keys.

- Randomly placed food items.

- Score tracking based on the number of food items eaten.

- Game over screen with a retry button.


# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple two-player game implemented using Python and Tkinter. Players take turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features
- 3x3 grid for the game

- Player turn indication

- Automatic winner detection

- Game reset functionality


# Text-editor

## Features
- Change text color.

- Change font and size.

- Create new files, open existing files, and save files.

- Cut, copy, and paste functionality.


# Calculator
The Calculator is a basic application implemented using Python and Tkinter. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Clear and delete functionality.
